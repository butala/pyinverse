# pyinverse
Python inverse problem module.

I use the following to install the module on my system:

`pip3 -e pyinverse`

Take a look at the Jupyter notebook files in the `notebooks` subdirectory.

To run this code, you will need Python >= 3.7 (or 3.6 with a backport of `dataclasses`) the following Python modules (I'm sure a few more are required and I should update the list):
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
