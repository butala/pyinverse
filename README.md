# pyinverse
Python inverse problem module.

I use the following to install the module on my system:

`python3 setup.py develop`

Take a look at the Jupyter notebook files in the `notebooks` subdirectory.

To run this code, you will need Python >= 3.7 (or 3.6 with a backport of `dataclasses`)  the following Python modules:
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `matplotlib`
